# Wine Quality Prediction

Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics. This project demonstrates a real-world application of machine learning in the field of viticulture by analyzing various chemical features and predicting wine quality using multiple classification models.

Dataset
The dataset contains diverse chemical attributes of wine, including:  
- Density  
- Acidity  
- Other relevant chemical features  

These features are used to train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting wine quality.

Key Concepts and Challenges
- Classifier Models: Implemented Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for predictive analysis.  
- Feature Analysis: Selected and analyzed chemical attributes to improve model performance.  
- Data Visualization: Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize patterns and insights.  
- Data Preprocessing: Performed cleaning, normalization, and handling of missing values.

Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas.  
- Conducted data preprocessing and feature selection.  
- Visualized feature distributions and relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib.  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
- Built and trained classifier models: Random Forest, SGD, and SVC.  
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Compared models and selected the best-performing classifier.

Tools and Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas (Data manipulation)  
- Numpy (Array operations)  
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (Data visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine learning models and evaluation)

Outcome
- Successfully trained three classifier models to predict wine quality.  
- Visualized chemical feature relationships and their influence on wine quality.  
- Identified the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics, achieving reliable predictions for wine quality.  

Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning to further improve model performance.  
- Experimenting with ensemble methods for better accuracy.  
- Deploying the model as a web application for real-time wine quality prediction.
